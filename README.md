## Architecture

### Screen Navigation

URL-based routing with History API (no router library). Every path maps to a screen type.

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    state "Landing (/)" as Landing
    state "DifficultyPicker (/)" as Diff
    state "SoloGame (/solo/:diff/:key)" as Solo
    state "DailyGame (/daily)" as Daily
    state "MultiplayerScreen (/:roomId)" as MP
    state "JoinScreen (/join)" as Join
    state "Stats (/stats)" as Stats

    Landing --> Diff: Start Solo / Create Game
    Landing --> Daily: Daily Challenge
    Landing --> Join: Join Game
    Landing --> Stats: View Stats
    Landing --> Solo: Continue saved game
    Landing --> MP: Accept friend invite

    Diff --> Solo: Solo mode + pick difficulty
    Diff --> MP: Create mode + pick difficulty
    Diff --> Landing: Back

    Join --> MP: Enter room code
    Join --> Landing: Back

    Solo --> Solo: Rematch (replace history)
    Solo --> Landing: Back (confirm if in progress)

    Daily --> Landing: Back

    MP --> Landing: Back

    Stats --> Landing: Back
```

### Multiplayer Lifecycle

The full flow from room creation through game completion, showing what data travels where.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant A as Player A (Host)
    participant S as Signaling Server<br>signal.dokuel.com
    participant B as Player B

    Note over A: Creates room, generates roomId
    A->>S: WSS subscribe(roomId)
    A->>A: Yjs Doc created, joinRoom()

    B->>S: WSS subscribe(roomId)
    S-->>A: Peer discovery (WebRTC offer)
    A-->>B: WebRTC answer (direct P2P link)

    Note over A,B: WebRTC established — signaling server no longer involved

    B->>A: joinRoom() synced via Yjs CRDT
    Note over A,B: Lobby: both players visible, can rename

    A->>B: startGame() — puzzle + solution via Y.Map
    Note over A,B: Each player solves independently

    loop During gameplay
        A->>B: updateProgress(cellsRemaining, %)
        B->>A: updateProgress(cellsRemaining, %)
    end

    B->>A: claimWinner() — first complete board wins
    Note over A,B: GameResult shown, rematch available
```

### Multiplayer Network Topology

Two separate Yjs rooms serve different purposes. Game data never touches the server.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    subgraph "Game Room (per match)"
        A[Player A] <-->|"Y.Map: puzzle, progress,<br>winner, status<br>(WebRTC direct)"| B[Player B]
    end

    subgraph "Presence Room (global)"
        A2[Player A] <-->|"Awareness: online status<br>Y.Map: game invites<br>(WebRTC direct)"| B2[Player B]
    end

    S[Signaling Server<br>signal.dokuel.com<br>Cloudflare Worker]

    A -.->|peer discovery only| S
    B -.->|peer discovery only| S
    A2 -.->|peer discovery only| S
    B2 -.->|peer discovery only| S
```

### Solo Game Data Flow

Shows how user input flows through the layered architecture to update the board and persist state.

```mermaid

    subgraph Input
        KB[useKeyboard<br>arrow keys, 1-9, N, Del, Ctrl+Z]
        NP[NumPad<br>digit buttons, erase]
        GC[GameControls<br>undo, hint, notes, pause]
    end

    subgraph "useSudoku Hook"
        D[dispatch action]
        R[sudokuReducer<br>PLACE_NUMBER, ERASE,<br>UNDO, HINT, TOGGLE_NOTES]
        DS[Derived state via useMemo<br>conflicts, errors,<br>remainingCounts, cellsRemaining]
    end

    subgraph "Pure Logic (src/lib)"
        E[sudoku engine<br>generate, solve, validate]
        H[hint-engine<br>naked-single, hidden-single]
        DL[daily.ts<br>seeded RNG]
    end

    subgraph Persistence
        GS[game-storage<br>auto-save board + timer]
        ST[stats<br>best time, average, games played]
        SK[daily-streak<br>current + longest streak]
    end

    subgraph Feedback
        B[Board<br>cell highlights, conflicts, hints]
        HB[HintBanner<br>technique explanation]
        HP[haptics + sounds]
    end

    KB --> D
    NP --> D
    GC --> D
    D --> R
    R --> DS
    R -- HINT action --> H
    H --> E
    DL --> E
    DS --> B
    R -- activeHint --> HB
    R -- status change --> HP
    DS -- board changes --> GS
    R -- completion --> ST
    R -- daily completion --> SK

### Key Design Decisions

- **Peer-to-peer multiplayer** — game state syncs via Yjs CRDTs over WebRTC. A self-hosted Cloudflare Worker at `signal.dokuel.com` handles peer discovery; all game data flows directly between players
- **React hooks only** — `useReducer` for game state, no external state library
- **Three-level assist system** — Paper (no assistance), Standard (conflict highlighting + auto-clear notes), Full (conflicts + row/column highlighting). Configurable at difficulty selection and during gameplay
- **Friends without accounts** — shareable friend codes, online presence via Yjs awareness, game invites from the landing page
- **No accounts** — auto-generated fun names (adjective + animal), persisted in localStorage; session identity in sessionStorage for reconnect
- **Colocated tests** — `*.test.ts` / `*.test.tsx` files sit next to the code they test
